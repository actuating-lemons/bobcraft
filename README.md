# What is this?
A re-imagining of Minecraft 1.2.5, On the minetest game engine.\
This project aims to;
 - First, replicate the Minecraft 1.2.5 experience
 - Then, expand upon the concepts and gameplay features of MC 1.2.5, while retaining a classic feel.
 - Include select features from newer versions.
 - Add features the base Minecraft game is lacking (Vertical slabs, anyone?).
 - Offer up a different, but still engaging gameplay experience.

This project does **NOT** aim to;
 - Act as a replacement for Minecraft.
 - Completely clone everything Minecraft does.
